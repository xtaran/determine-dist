Motivation: Why?
----------------

Situations
~~~~~~~~~~

* Big, heterogene networks with many different administrators
* Potentially incomplete lists of inherited servers
* Suspected compromise of somebody else's Linux/Unix machine

Questions in these situations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Which distribution and which release is running on that machine?
* Is the operating system "end of life"?
* Are security updates applied?

And you usually want the answers _fast_. :-)


Motivation: Doesn't such tools already exist?
---------------------------------------------

There are many tools, which recognize operating systems and unpatched
daemons. But most of them are slow, imprecise, or both:

* Nessus, OpenVAS & Co:

** Very slow, needs minutes per server.

** They search for specific security holes.

** They sometimes just use upstream version numbers to make statements
   about security issues â€” often leads to false positives.
   (Distributions just fix security issues without bumping the upstream
   version.)

** They might overload the checked service or server.

* Nmap:

** Slow, still takes seconds per host even with `-F -T
   aggressive`.

** OS detection rather rough, just based on network package metadata
   (e.g. TTL and TCP Window Size), not contents.

** Needs at least one closed and one open port to detect the OS.

* p0f:

** Only passive, not active

** Inaccurate with modern operating systems.

Scanning a whole /16 network (65536 IP addresses) takes a lot of time
and isn't very precise. ðŸ˜­


Motivation: There are alternatives!
-----------------------------------

* Many daemons tell their version in every or some simple server
  responses.

* A specific daemon version is only shipped in one or a few
  distribution releases.

* Quite some packaged daemons tell their exact distribution package
  version, especially OpenSSH.

* Port 22 (SSH) is active on nearly every Linux/Unix server and often
  reachable at least from internal networks.

* Some daemons even tell you the kernel version under which they're
  running.


Data Sources 1/5: SSH
---------------------

.Example 1
----
$ echo 'foobar' | nc rancidbox 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.3
Protocol mismatch.
----

Did you guess the distribution? Now that was easy!

But there's more: The version number tells us that this is an Ubuntu
16.04 LTS (or close derivative), which misses OpenSSH security updates
mid-2018 - and probably other security updates, too.

.Example 2
----
$ echo 'foobar' | nc ohoh 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4+deb7u10
Protocol mismatch.
----

Here is even the Debian release easily recognizable since the suffix
`â€¦+deb7uâ€¦` is only used for Debian 7 Wheezy updates. Wheezy's ELTS is
EoL since New Year's Eve.

.Example 3.1
----
$ echo 'foobar' | nc somewhat-ambiguous 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4
Protocol mismatch.
----

More difficult. RHEL 7.4+? Or macOS 10.12.4 to 10.12.6?

TIP: Despite Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not a BSD, it lacks the
otherwise typical `p1` of the "portable"version of OpenSSH.

But there's more than just SSHâ€¦


Data Sources 2/5: Web Server
----------------------------

Let's continue the previous example and have a look at another daemon:

.Example 3.2
----
$ HEAD http://somewhat-ambiguous/
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: [â€¦]
Server: Apache/2.4.6 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
----

The ambiguity is now gone: It's a RHEL 7.4+

TIP: Apache nowadays doesn't even tell its version. But especially the
commercial distributions seem to value the effect of global usage
statistics more than not patching their daemons with their product
nameâ€¦ :-)


Data Sources 3/5: Mail Server
-----------------------------

.Example 4
----
$ echo QUIT | nc my-mail-server 25
220 my-mail-server ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)
221 2.0.0 Bye
$ echo QUIT | nc a-friends-mail-server 25
220-a-friends-mail-server ESMTP Proxmox
221 2.0.0 Bye
$ echo QUIT | nc another-mail-server 25
220 another-mail-server ESMTP Exim 4.86_2 Ubuntu Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:35:32 +0200
221 another-mail-server closing connection
----

Here we often don't get the daemon version, but clearly the
distribution.


Data Sources 4/5: DNS Server
----------------------------

.Example 5
----
$ dig +short -t txt -c chaos version.bind @ams.sns-pb.isc.org
"9.9.7-P2"

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @a.iana-servers.net
"Knot DNS 2.6.3"

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @ns.nlnetlabs.nl
"NSD 4.2.2"

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT one-of-my-dns-servers
"9.9.5-9+deb8u18-Debian"

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT some-rhel7
"9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-9.P2.el7"

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT another-rhel7
"9.9.4-RedHat-9.9.4-74.el7_6.2"

$ dig version.bind ch txt +short @127.0.0.1
"unbound 1.9.4"

$ dig version.bind ch txt +short @192.168.1.1
"dnsmasq-2.78"
----

Also DNS servers bespeak much.

But not seldomly, they also reveal nothing or only what the
administrators want to reveal explicitly:

.Example 6
----
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @8.8.8.8

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @a.ns.nic.cz

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @ns2.switch.ch
"contact dns-operation@switch.ch"

$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @a.nic.de
"ns-1.de.nl1.bind"
----


Data Sources 5/5: Open Database Servers
---------------------------------------

At this point it becomes clear that this kind of information gathering
is not only for analyzing internal systems but might also be helpful
with e.g. pen-testing.

Open Redis Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Example 7
----
$ redis-cli -h unintentionally-open-redis-server
redis> info
# Server
redis_version:3.0.7
redis_git_sha1:3c968ff0
redis_git_dirty:0
redis_build_id:51089de051945df4
redis_mode:standalone
os:Linux 3.10.0-957.21.3.el7.x86_64 x86_64
arch_bits:64
multiplexing_api:epoll
atomicvar_api:atomic-builtin
gcc_version:6.3.0
process_id:1
run_id:b770a8af038963f3d1b55358c2e376d0b5e00182
tcp_port:6379
uptime_in_seconds:1344070
uptime_in_days:15
[â€¦]
----

This tells us a lot:

* OS is RHEL 7 (because of the `el7` in the kernel version)

* Redis runs inside a container (Docker, etc.) due to process ID `1` â€”
  which is usually the pid of the init system.

* Intel/AMD 64 bit architecture

TIP: More examples at: https://www.shodan.io/search?query=6379

Open MongoDB Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's one and the same thing for open MongoDB servers

TIP: Examples at https://www.shodan.io/search?query=distmod


Dist-Detect: Purpose
--------------------

Automating the so far manual analysis of daemon responses.

Quickly getting an ideaâ€¦

* which Linux/BSD/Unix distribution and which release is running on a
  remote system;

* if the admin applies security updates regularly; and

* if the remote system runs an OS release which is "end of life",

only by looking at the responses of a few common network daemons â€” without disturbing the service.


Focus on Low Hanging Fruits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* As *few false positives* as possible: If the program finds something
  bad, it's also bad.

* *False Negatives are expected*: Unknown or ambiguous versions
  stay unknown or ambiguous.


Dist-Detect: Components
-----------------------

Infrastructure / Cron Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Downloader: Downloads package lists and release information (EoL dates,
  etc.) of configured distributions.

* Scraper: parses these package lists and documents in a database,

** which version is in which distribution and which release;

** which old versionen have existed (calculated/guessed) and
   are no more up to date;

** issues tags like `EoL`, `LTS`, `ELTS`, `ESM`, `Backport`, `Ancient`
  (older than the longest available support interval), `Bleeding Edge`
  (newest OpenSSH version), â€¦

Operation: Scanning and Analysing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Scanner: collects daemon responses

* Interpreter: interprets the daemon responses and searches in the
  database for

** according distributions and releases, and

** tags


Dist-Detect: State of the Project
---------------------------------

"Work in Progress"

* A downloader and scraper for Debian, Ubuntu and Raspbian package
  repositories exists.

* An (SSH-) scanner (native) works and is relatively fast (ca. 10-15
  seconds per /24 network), if all hosts are online.

* The database-based interpreter works, but currently only knows
  Debian and derivates. RHEL/CentOS and macOS are recognized via
  static rules (configuration files).



Dist-Detect: Plans
------------------

* Write a package list downloader and scraper for CentOS, openSUSE and
  macOS (e.g. via opensource.apple.com).

* Ping before scan (probably with fping)

* Making the output more readable, maybe two variants:

** human-readable

** machine-readable

** Or a format which offers both, maybe YAML.

//* Debian 8 Jessie currently can be found on both, the normal mirrors
//  as well as in the historic archive. This situation is currently not
//  handled correctly.

* Support further Debian derivates â†’
  https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census

** Supported distributions like Trisquel, Linux Mint, Kali Linux, â€¦

** Maybe Live CDs like Grml and Knoppix

** Discontinued distributions (you want to detect them, too) like
   Tanglu.

* Save the currently newest OpenSSH version in the database.

** Source: Maybe use APIs of https://repology.org/ or https://www.wikidata.org/

* Unit Testing (Travis CI and friends)

* Packaging (mostly CPAN and Debian)


Dist-Detect: Ideas
------------------

* Also save the scan results and scan dates in a database.

* Optional scanning backends

** SSH: scanssh, ZMap's ZGrab with its "x/crypto SSH scanner" plugin.

** Generic TCP: pnscan, masscan, ZMap, pf_ring?

** Every service which tells you the exact kernel version (like open
   Redis and MongoDB servers. ;-)

** Online (i.e. publicly available data):

*** Shodan.io?

*** Nessus-/OpenVAS-Reports?

* Query additionally services (HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, DNS, etc.) only in case of
  ambiguity? (Would mix gathering and interpreting. â˜¹)

* Distinguish more between package repositories, in which the SSH
  signatures change often and those where they change seldomly.

* Figure out, how to query build information from Synology NAS via
  MDNS.

* Parse package changelogs to get all previous package versions â€”
  instead of guessing. (Can have disadvantages, too.)

* Negative facts ("can't be a RedHat")

* Automatically generate SNORT/Suricata and/or Bro/Zeek rules for
  banners of non-up-to-date or end-of-life version of SSH servers and
  clients.
