Agenda
------

* Motivation

* Data sources: Where do I find hints on the used distribution?

* Implementation: current state and plans

Slides
~~~~~~

* https://github.com/xtaran/dist-detect â†’ slides â†’ dist-detect-slides_en.adoc, oder
* https://github.com/xtaran/dist-detect/blob/master/slides/dist-detect-slides_en.adoc

Motivation: Why?
----------------

Situations
~~~~~~~~~~

* Big, heterogene networks with many different administrators.
* Getting an overview over potentially incomplete lists of inherited
  servers.
* Suspected compromise of a Linux/Unix machine you don't know
  personally.

Questions in these situations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Which distribution and which release is running on that machine?
* Is the operating system "end of life"?
* Are security updates applied?

And you usually want the answers _fast_. :-)


Motivation: Doesn't such tools already exist?
---------------------------------------------

There are many tools, which recognize operating systems and unpatched
daemons. But most of them are slow, imprecise, or both:

* Nessus, OpenVAS & Co:

** Slow, needs minutes per server and hours to days depending on the
   network size.

** They search for specific security holes, and don't do a general
   judgement or classification.

** They sometimes just use upstream version numbers to make statements
   about security issues â€” which often leads to false positives as
   distributions often just fix security issues without bumping to a
   new upstream release.

** They may overload the checked service or server due to trying out
   many exploits.

* Nmap:

** Very slow, even with `-T aggressive`

** operating system detection very inaccurate, just based on network
   package metadata, not contents.

** Needs at least one closed and one open port to detect the operating
   system.

* p0f:

** Only passive, not active

** Inaccurate with modern operating systems.

Scanning a whole /16 network (65536 IP addresses) takes a lot of time
and isn't very precise. ðŸ˜­


Motivation: There are alternatives!
-----------------------------------

* Many daemons tell their version in every or some simple server
  responses.

* A specific daemon version is only shipped in one or a few
  distribution releases.

* Quite some packaged daemons tell their exact distribution package
  version, especially OpenSSH.

* Port 22 (SSH) is active on nearly every Linux/Unix server and often
  reachable at least from internal networks,

* Some daemons even tell you the kernel version under which they're
  running.


Data Sources 1/6: SSH
---------------------

.Example 1
----
$ echo 'foobar' | nc rancidbox 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.3
Protocol mismatch.
----

Did you guess the distribution?

Now that was easy!

But we can get more information out of this: The version number tells
us that this is an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (or close derivative), which
misses OpenSSH security updates mid-2018 - and probably other security
updates, too.

.Example 2
----
$ echo 'foobar' | nc ohoh 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_6.0p1 Debian-4+deb7u10
Protocol mismatch.
----

Here is even the Debian release easily recognizable since the suffix
`â€¦+deb7uâ€¦` is only used for Debian 7 Wheezy updates. Wheezy still has ELTS
until the end of the year (if Intel architecture), but virtuallyâ„¢ is already
EoL clearly will be EoL on New Year's Eve.

.Example 3.1
----
$ echo 'foobar' | nc somewhat-ambiguous 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.4
Protocol mismatch.
----

Already more difficult. Might be a RHEL 7.4 onwards or a macOS 10.12.4
to 10.12.6.

Despite Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not a BSD, it misses the otherwise
typical `p1` of the "portable"version of OpenSSH.

But we can look at more than just SSHâ€¦


Data Sources 2/6: Web Server
----------------------------

Let's continue the previous example and have a look at another daemon:

.Example 3.2
----
$ HEAD http://somewhat-ambiguous/
200 OK
Connection: close
Date: [â€¦]
Server: Apache/2.4.6 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
----

Now the previous ambiguity is gone: It's a RHEL 7.

Hinweis
~~~~~~~

* Especially Apache nowadays doesn't even tell its version. But
  especially the commercial distributions seem to value the effect of
  global usage statistics more than not patching their daemons with
  their product nameâ€¦ :-)


Data Sources 3/6: Mail Server
-----------------------------

.Example 4
----
$ echo QUIT | nc my-mail-server 25
220 my-mail-server ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU)
221 2.0.0 Bye
$ echo QUIT | nc a-friends-mail-server 25
220-a-friends-mail-server ESMTP Proxmox
221 2.0.0 Bye
$ echo QUIT | nc another-mail-server 25
220 another-mail-server ESMTP Exim 4.86_2 Ubuntu Thu, 10 Oct 2019 17:35:32 +0200
221 another-mail-server closing connection
----

Here we often don't get the daemon version, but clearly the
distribution.


Data Sources 4/6: DNS Server
----------------------------

.Example 5
----
$ dig +short -t txt -c chaos version.bind @ams.sns-pb.isc.org
"9.9.7-P2"
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @a.iana-servers.net
"Knot DNS 2.6.3"
 dig +short version.bind CH TXT @ns.nlnetlabs.nl
"NSD 4.2.2"
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT one-of-my-dns-servers
"9.9.5-9+deb8u18-Debian"
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT some-rhel7
"9.11.4-P2-RedHat-9.11.4-9.P2.el7"
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT anothe-rrhel7
"9.9.4-RedHat-9.9.4-74.el7_6.2"
$ dig version.bind ch txt +short @127.0.0.1
"unbound 1.9.4"
$ dig version.bind ch txt +short @192.168.1.1
"dnsmasq-2.78"
----

Also DNS servers bespeak much.

But not seldomly, they also reveal nothing or only what the
administrators want to reveal explicitly:

.Example 6
----
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @8.8.8.8
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @a.ns.nic.cz
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @ns2.switch.ch
"contact dns-operation@switch.ch"
$ dig +short version.bind CH TXT @a.nic.de
"ns-1.de.nl1.bind"
----


Data Sources 5/6: Open Redis Servers
------------------------------------

At this point it becomes clear that this kind of information gathering
is not only for analyzing internal systems but might also be helpful
with e.g. pen-testing.

.Example 7
----
$ redis-cli -h unintentionally-open-redis-server
redis> info
# Server
redis_version:3.0.7
redis_git_sha1:3c968ff0
redis_git_dirty:0
redis_build_id:51089de051945df4
redis_mode:standalone
os:Linux 3.10.0-957.21.3.el7.x86_64 x86_64
arch_bits:64
multiplexing_api:epoll
atomicvar_api:atomic-builtin
gcc_version:6.3.0
process_id:1
run_id:b770a8af038963f3d1b55358c2e376d0b5e00182
tcp_port:6379
uptime_in_seconds:1344070
uptime_in_days:15
[â€¦]
----

This tells us a lot:

* OS is RHEL 7 (because of the `el7` in the kernel version)

* Redis runs inside a container (Docker, etc.) due to process ID `1` â€”
  which is usually the pid of the init system.

* Intel/AMD 64 bit architecture

Data Sources 6/6: Open MongoDB Servers
--------------------------------------

.Example 8

{
        "version" : "4.0.10",

Interesting for our purposes:

* `"distmod" : "ubuntu1804"`
* `"openssl" : { [â€¦], "compiled" : "OpenSSL 1.1.0g  2 Nov 2017" }`

Dist-Detect: Purpose
--------------------

Automating the so far manual analysis of daemon responses.

Quickly getting an ideaâ€¦

* which Linux/BSD/Unix distribution and which release is running on a
  remote system;

* if the admin applies security updates regularly; and

* if the remote system runs an OS release which is "end of life",

only by looking at the responses of a few common network daemons â€” without disturbing the service.


Focus on Low Hanging Fruits
---------------------------

* As *few false positives* as possible: If the program finds something
  bad, it's also bad.

* *False Negatives are expected*: Unknown or ambiguous versions
  stay unknown or ambiguous.


Dist-Detect: Components
-----------------------

Infrastructure / Cron Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Downloader: Downloads package lists and release information (EoL dates,
  etc.) of configured distributions.

* Scraper: parses these package lists and documents in a database,

** which version is in which distribution and which release;

** which old versionen have existed (calculated/guessed) and
   are no more up to date;

** issues tags like `EoL`, `LTS`, `ELTS`, `ESM`, `Backport`, `Ancient`
  (older than the longest available support interval), `Bleeding Edge`
  (newest OpenSSH version), â€¦

Operation: Scanning and Analysing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Scanner: collects daemon responses

* Interpreter: interprets the daemon responses and searches in the
  database for

** according distributions and releases, and

** tags


Dist-Detect: State of the Project
---------------------------------

"Work in Progress"

* A downloader and scraper for Debian, Ubuntu and Raspbian package
  repositories exists.

* An (SSH-) scanner (native) works and is relatively fast (ca. 10-15
  seconds per /24 network), if all hosts are online.

* The database-based interpreter works, but currently only knows
  Debian and derivates. RHEL/CentOS and macOS are recognized via
  static rules (configuration files).

Dist-Detect: TODO
-----------------

* Write a package list downloader and scraper for CentOS, openSUSE and
  macOS.

* Make a difference between package repositories, in which the SSH
  signatures change often (with package version in the banner) and
  those where they change seldemly (without package version in the banner).

* Making the output more readable, maybe two variants:

** human-readable

** machine-readable

** Or a format which offers both, maybe YAML.

* Debian 8 Jessie currently can be found on both, the normal mirrors
  as well as in the historic archive. This situation is currently not
  handled correctly.

* Support further Debian derivates â†’
  https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census

** Supported distributions like Trisquel, Linux Mint, Kali Linux, â€¦

** Live CDs like Tails, Grml and Knoppix

** Discontinued distributions (you want to detect them, too) like
   Tanglu.


Dist-Detect: Plans
------------------

* Save the currently newest OpenSSH version in the database â†’
  `bin/newest-openssh-version-on-*.pl`

* Query additionally services (HTTP/HTTPS, SMTP, DNS, etc.) in case of
  ambiguity (or maybe always?)

* Unit Testing

** Travis CI
** Coveralls

* Package for CPAN.

** probably with `Dist::Zilla` aka `dzil`

* Package for Debian.

** probably with `dh-dist-zilla`.


Dist-Detect: Ideas
------------------

* Also save the scan results and scan dates in a database.

* Check if SIP services can be used for this, too.

* Parse package changelogs to get all previous package versions â€”
  instead of guessing.

* Optional scanning backends

** SSH: scanssh, ZMap's ZGrab with its "x/crypto SSH scanner" plugin.

** Generic TCP: pnscan, masscan, ZMap, pf_ring?

** Every service which tells you the exact kernel version (like open
   Redis and MongoDB servers. ;-)

** Online (i.e. publicly available data):

*** Shodan.io?

*** Nessus-/OpenVAS-Reports?

* Ping before scan (probably with fping)

* Maybe use https://repology.org/api and
  https://repology.org/project/openssh/versions

* Maybe yse https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q847062 and
  https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:EntityData/Q847062.json

* Negative facts ("can't be a RedHat")

* Let the package list parser optionally generate rules from every
  banner of a non-up-to-date or end-of-life version for SNORT (and
  hence also Suricata) and/or Zeek (formerly known as Bro).
